1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- Media class should be implemented the Comparable interface.
2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
- I'll compare one feature first, then another feature like in Media class, i have MediaCompareByCostTitle (compare cost then compare title). So, the code to implement the compareTo() method is in my MediaComparatorCostTitle class just change method name to Comparable.
3.  Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
- No we can't. We use Comparable just for one default sorting like 'compare cost then compare title'. For example:
// implement compareTo()
Collections.sort(..) // It's default using compareTo() to sort.
4. Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
- I will use Comparator overriding compare() method. Then compare each attribute respectively. (by title, then decreasing length, then cost)
